# usdves
Web app that shows the historic data of the USD/VES pair taken from different
sources.

In the current version of the app the only source is the Central Bank of
Venezuela [BCV](http://www.bcv.org.ve/).

## ToDo List

- [ ] Let the user filter the data by year and month
- [ ] Let the user download the filtered data
- [ ] Let the user choose between csv and xlsx format for the file
- [ ] Include a currency conversor that utilizes the price of the day
- [ ] Show a graph that shows the USD/VES pair on different scales
- [ ] Allow the app to receive and answer GET requests
