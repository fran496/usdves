```

## Inputs 
## Embedded Application

It's also possible to embed an entire Shiny application within an R Markdown document using the `shinyAppDir` function. This example embeds a Shiny application located in another directory:

```{r tabsets, echo=FALSE}
shinyAppDir(
  system.file("usdves", package = "shiny"),
  options = list(
    width = "100%", height = 550
  )
)
```
